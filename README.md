# Challenge3_Python
Third Challenge for UofR data Bootcamp

This challenge was definitely difficult at first because I was having trouble figuring out why some values wouldn't add to each other when I tried to add them, and why some wouldn't print either. 

After some review of past lectures, I found that my issues were with trying to take averages of string instead of integers, which made everything fall into place afterwards.

The only other catching point that I had was when I was trying to print to a text file. I found some new and interesting ways to print new folders if they don't already exist within the user's finder / document explorer, but couldn't quite find out how to write a file directly to that folder after creating it. So I ended up going with a different method for printing a text file.

During this assignment, I didn't receive any outside help, and only used resources to help me learn more about the .get function in python to be able to correctly output the greatest increase & decrease from the pybank assignment.
